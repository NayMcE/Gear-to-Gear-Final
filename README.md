# Gear-to-Gear-Final
CFG Final Project

My final project - A website for a cycling club that offers multiple services.

Had a lot of fun designing the webpage desptite a lot of errors and bugs along the way, it is always such an incredible sense of achivement when it works.
Still so much to learn but loving the process and have gained so much more experience doing this course.
